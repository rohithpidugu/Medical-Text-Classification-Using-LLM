# Medical Text Classification using LLMs

**Description:**

This project aims to develop a system for classifying medical text using Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to accurately categorize medical documents, patient notes, or research papers into predefined medical categories.

## Project Goals

* Accurately classify medical text into relevant categories.
* Evaluate the performance of various LLMs on medical text classification tasks.
* Develop a user-friendly interface or API for accessing the classification system.
* Explore the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for specific medical domains.

## Planned Features

* Text preprocessing and cleaning.
* Feature extraction using LLMs.
* Model training and evaluation.
* Integration with a medical terminology database (e.g., SNOMED CT).
* Web-based interface or API.

## Technologies

* Python
* Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-3.5, BERT, etc.)
* Libraries: Transformers, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
* (Add more as you plan them)
